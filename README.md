# OpenDRIVE Testfeld A9

The OpenDRIVE datasets of two sections of the German Autobahn A9 were originally provided by the [MDM Portal](https://service.mdm-portal.de/mdm-portal-application/publDetail.do?publicationId=2594000) as open data.
However, since the migration to the new [Mobilithek](https://mobilithek.info/offers/573178449617657856), the download of the respective files no longer works.

As they are licensed under [Nutzungsbestimmungen f√ºr die Bereitstellung von Geodaten des Bundes](https://sg.geodatenzentrum.de/web_public/gdz/lizenz/geonutzv.pdf) and in order to ensure their continued usability, they are made available in this repository as an interim solution.
